The only Dwarf standing stares at the piercing gaze of Teine the colossal dragon his body battered and tarnished with arrows and axes, The Warrior standing with his golden axe in both hands constricts to take a mighty swing for the dargon as the beasts inhaling to let out a destructive and blazing inferno of red hot fire. suddenly as both parties release their attacks the screen fades to black.</h3>
